* Must-Haves
	* Any documentation at all, other than the code comments!
	* Fix the $options parameter in Table::__construct() - it should *merge* with
	  the defaults, not replace it wholesale. (This allows table type to be passed
	  in without requiring the charset, too).

* Niceties
	* It would be nice to tidy up the migrate command, as it's a wrapper around the old Ladder class at present.
	* Automatic backup prior to an update migration.
	* Automatic un-update, using the backup from the previous note.
